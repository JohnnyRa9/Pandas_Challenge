# Pandas_Challenge
The purpose of this analysis is to provide data that will help drive budget decision within a school district that has 15 schools and over 39,000 students. The data was gathered from two files with information about each individual school, their math & reading scores, the budget of each school, and the size of each school. The data was compiled into multiple data frames using Python Pandas to provide insight into the data and help drive data driven decisions.

I will provide a few notable trends based on the data:

The data shows that the top 5 schools were all charter schools and they ranged in size from 962 students to 2,283 students. The top 5 schools spent between $578-$638 per student and had an overall passing rate of 90.5%-91.3% when you average their math and reading scores.

The data shows that the bottom 5 schools were district schools and they ranged in size from 2,917 students to 4,761 students. The bottom 5 schools spent between $637-$655 per student and had an overall passing rate of 52.9%-53.5% when you average their math and reading scores.

The data indicates that district schools trailed behing charter schools overall passing score by about 36.8% while having almost double the budget than charter schools.
